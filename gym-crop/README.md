# CropGym

### Introduction
This is the CropGym environment, an OpenAI gym environment where agents can learn to fertilize wheat, as described in ["CropGym: a Reinforcement Learning Environment for Crop Management"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04326) by Hiske Overweg, Herman N.C. Berghuijs and Ioannis N. Athanasiadis. 

### Installation
The code has been tested using python 3.8.5.

Clone this repository and install the crop gym environment with the following command

[This patch](https://github.com/ajwdewit/pcse/pull/43) to the PCSE package is required to be able to run the code.
